# Callsign üõ∞Ô∏è

**Callsign** is a modern, VS Code-native OpenAPI companion built for full-stack developers. It simplifies local API development by providing an integrated, fast, and beautiful interface for exploring, testing, and generating code from OpenAPI specs‚Äîall without leaving VS Code.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üîç **OpenAPI Viewer** ‚Äî Beautiful, readable endpoint explorer grouped by tags, like Swagger UI, but faster and more responsive.
-   üß© **VS Code Native** ‚Äî Works directly in your editor, with no browser tabs or context switching.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Expandable Endpoints** ‚Äî Click any endpoint to view method, description, request body, response schema, and more.
-   üß™ **Interactive Testing (planned)** ‚Äî Run API requests from inside the panel with saved environment headers.
-   üõ†Ô∏è **Client Code Generation (planned)** ‚Äî Generate TypeScript client code for calling endpoints, scoped by tag.
-   üß™ **Mock Server Preview (planned)** ‚Äî Generate mock endpoints to simulate backend during frontend development.
-   üéØ **Lightweight & Fast** ‚Äî Minimal dependencies and native performance inside the VS Code webview.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## üì¶ Requirements

Callsign reads OpenAPI JSON files. You can:

-   Load a local file.
-   Load a remote OpenAPI URL (CORS must be enabled).
-   Auto-load from a `swagger.json` in your workspace (coming soon).

> No external services required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

-   `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
-   `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

> TODO: Add settings when environment variables, theme customization, or auto-loading are implemented.

## üíª Who It's For

Callsign is built for:

-   Frontend developers consuming REST APIs.
-   Full-stack teams working locally across frontend/backend code.
-   Developers who prefer working **inside VS Code**.

## üêû Known Issues

-   Currently only supports OpenAPI v3 JSON.
-   No support for authentication headers or auth flows (coming soon).
-   Testing feature is in progress.
